## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is Jasper, i am a Student in the field of Multimedia and Communication. 
I am interested in Sound-Design, Audio-Engineering, Electronic Music and really anything Audio-Related.

Currently i am working on developing a digital hardware DIY Synthesizer, based on the Electrosmith Daisyseed and PlugData. 
My Goal is compiling and creating a toolset for beginners in audio programming, enabling to program and build their first Synthesizer. :)
